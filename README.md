# core-api

Super-duper early version of this API for code-sharing purposes primarily.
Will flesh out this README once it's more complete.

## Still to do
- standard means for the user to generate and apply their own context
- "connect"-ing in-places
- one-shot events
- the time API
- WAYYYYYY more examples
